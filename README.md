# Real-Time-Weather
We have to check the weather daily; I have created a website using HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT, which shows the current weather of the location you want and gives an in-depth analysis of it. 

## API
**https://open-meteo.com/**
Used Javascript geolocation API to fetch the current latitudes and longitudes, which are fed into the open-meteo API to get Today's as well as forecast of 5 days ahead.
